# robotic-gestures

In Spring of 2023, I worked in the Robotic Musicianship Lab at Georgia Tech. Here are the gestures I implemented on the robot.

After analyzing musicians play in improvised jam bands, we observed enthusiastic reactions from a musician when they were immersed and approving of another's music. I sought to recreate this.
