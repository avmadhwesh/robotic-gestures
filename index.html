        <h1>Gestures made for Shimon @ the Robotic Musicianship Lab
            Georgia Tech, Atlanta</h1>
        <p>Musical improvisation is a fascinating and lesser-studied aspect of music performance. While it is a common practice in various genres, the nonverbal communication between musicians during improvisation is not as well understood.</p>
        <p>In conversations, humans prompt each other to add on to each other's dialogues, creating a dynamic flow of interaction. Similarly, in musical genres such as jam bands, jazz bands, free jazz, ethnic genres, and rock, there is often an element of "turn-taking" during improvisation. Musicians seamlessly pass the lead from one to another, creating a rich, collaborative performance.</p>
        <p>Under the guidance of Dr. Weinberg and Jocelyn Kavanagh at the Robotic Musicianship Lab, I studied these dynamics in depth. We analyzed over 40 bands and artists, focusing on visual and musical cues that facilitated the transfer of melody or motifs among musicians. Our goal was to implement these findings on Shimon, the marimba-playing robot. In particular, we focused on unstructured performances to observe how musicians organically responded to uniquely improvised music. Watch Shimon in action.</p>

        <p>In our study, we identified a wide variety of gestures used by musicians. Some gestures were explicit, like pointing at each other, while others were implicit musical cues, such as decrescendos signaling the end of a climax and thus the end of a turn. Interestingly, we found that improvisation involved emotional responses that influenced these gestures. When a musician disliked the music—perhaps due to unexpected dissonance or rhythmic clashes—we observed grimaces or head shakes. Conversely, when a musician enjoyed the music, we saw enthusiastic nods and shouted ad-libs. These emotional responses appeared to play a role in how musicians decided to interrupt a turn or encourage its continuation.</p>
        <p>From there, I identified three key physical behaviors exhibited by multiple artists in response to music: joy, disgust, and an idle "jam" state.</p>
